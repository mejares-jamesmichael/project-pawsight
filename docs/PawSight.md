**PawSight: Pet Behavior Guide**

*Focus on the visual aspect of understanding pets.*

---

## 2. Objectives (Why are we building this?)

- **Educational Foundation**: To serve as a concise, reliable reference for common dog and cat body language, promoting better pet-owner communication.

- **Welfare Improvement**: To reduce stress and anxiety in pets by helping owners correctly interpret signals of fear, discomfort, or illness.

- **Efficient Tooling**: To provide a fast, offline-accessible resource for pet owners, sitters, and new adopters.

- **Mobile Development Focus**: To demonstrate proficiency in core mobile development concepts (data parsing, list rendering, local storage, native UI) using Flutter or Kotlin.

## 3. Core Features

| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Behavior Library** | A comprehensive list of 15-20 common behaviors (e.g., lip-licking, whale eye, tail tuck, purring patterns) with descriptions and corresponding visual aids (photos/short videos). | High |
| **Search and Filter** | Allows users to quickly search the library by keywords (e.g., "ear position," "yawn") and filter content by general mood (e.g., Playful, Anxious, Defensive). | High |
| **In-App Quizzes** | Simple multiple-choice quizzes (e.g., "What emotion does this posture indicate?") to reinforce learning and test user knowledge. | Medium |
| **Offline Content Access** | All primary behavior data and images are bundled with the application, ensuring functionality without an internet connection. | High |

## 4. Scope and Limitations

The following limitations are essential to ensure the project is completed on time:

- **Static Content Only**: Content (behaviors, text, images) will be pre-loaded and static (stored in a local JSON file or database). There will be no real-time content updates or a server-side content management system.

- **Device Focus**: The application will be a single-user experience. There will be no cloud syncing, user accounts, or sharing features.

- **Pet Scope**: The initial core features will focus only on Canine behavior, or, if time permits since it will be 1 sem only, we will add a smaller section for Feline behavior, but not both simultaneously in depth.

- **No Diagnostic Tools**: The app provides education, not medical advice or diagnosis.

## 5. Target Audience (Who needs this app?)

- **Primary Audience**: First-time dog/cat owners or prospective adopters.

- **Secondary Audience**: Current pet owners seeking to strengthen their bond and understanding of their animals.

- **Tertiary Audience**: Pet sitters, veterinary assistants, or animal shelter volunteers who require a quick behavior reference.
